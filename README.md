# GUC - GPU Microcontroller Compiler

GUC is a compiler for GPU microcontroller.
GUC has supporting fÎ¼c microcontrollers architecture.

#Installation Docs:

$(TOPDIR) will represent your top working directory, henceforth.
##Download

    cd $(TOPDIR)
    git clone git://0x04.net/envytools.git
    git clone git://github.com/cs005/guc.git
    
##envytools

envytools is a rich set of open-source tools to compile or decompile
NVIDIA GPU program code, firmware code, macro code, and so on. It is
also used to generate C header files with GPU command definitions.
In addition, envytools document the NVIDIA GPU architecture details,
while are not disclosed to the public so far. If you are interested 
in GPU system software development, this is what you should read!
Please follow the instruction below to install envytools.

    cd $(TOPDIR)/envytools
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. # may require some packages on your distro
    make
    sudo make install # will install tools to /usr/local/{bin,lib}

##GUC install

    cd $(TOPDIR)/guc/compiler
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../llvm/configure # if can't finished configure, add option.
    make
    sudo make install # will install tools. clang & llc

##Compile test
###Compile  
    cd $(TOPDIR)/guc/test/test_br
    make
###Execution test
    sudo make run

##Sample program
GUC have included a sample of some.
Summarize belows:

    test_br: This is a compilation test program of the branch.
    test_func: This is a compilation test program of the function.
    test_sp: This is a compilation test program of the iterative process.
    
    test_intr: The fuc has intrrupt handler. This program is using intrrupt.
    test_timer: The fuc has timer. This code is sample of using the timer intterupt.
    test_xfer: Xfer is the data transfer feature of fuc. This code is sample of using the xfer.
